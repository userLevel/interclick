    be considered to be, in all events and in each and every situation,
    scenario or circumstance a direct portion of the license below,
    notwithstanding that such RIDER A is not included herein, but is instead
    reproduced in the README.md file in this directory (i.e., a full,

    portion of the text of the license. Subject to the addition of the text,
    language and meaning of RIDER A, the Software (and, of course, its use)

    revise the meaning and permissions, as well as any other terms or
